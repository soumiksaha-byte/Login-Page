This is my **first hands-on React project**, where I built a simple **Login/Signup form** with toggle functionality. The project helped me understand **React components, state management using `useState`, conditional rendering, and basic CSS styling**.

---

## Features

- Toggle between **Login** and **SignUp** forms.
- Form inputs include:
  - Login: Email, Password
  - SignUp: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
- Basic client-side validation (SignUp password match check).
- Clean and responsive UI using **CSS**.
- Interactive buttons and form toggles.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – for building the frontend and components.
- **useState** – to manage form states and toggle between forms.
- **CSS** – for styling forms and buttons.
